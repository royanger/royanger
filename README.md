# Hi, I'm Roy!

I'm a full stack developer who creates bespoke sites for small businesses. I used WordPress for years, but have recently made the switch to React based sites with Node based custom APIs. I'm currently a freelancer working from home, but looking to transition into a full time position.

When I'm not coding, I dabble in design, spend time with my wife and our dog, read tons and enjoy video games.

## My Skillset

- **Languages:** JavaScript, PHP
- **Libraries and Frameworks:** React, Next.js, Node.js, Redux, Express
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS, Accessibility
- **Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
